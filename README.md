This is the project submission for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. 

Content of the  project is a book tracking application that enables a user to organize a list of books by storing them in three bookshelfs namely 'Currently Reading', 'Want to read', and 'Read'. 
The main page of the application shows the three shelfes and for each book inside a shelf, it's Title and Author(s) as well as an image of the book cover is dispayed.
The user can move the book from one shelf to another or remove the book by using a context menu attached to each book.
Additionally, the application has a search page, where the user can search for books via a books API provided by Udacity.
